# VS Code Extension - My Local AI

How to use:
1. Start backend server (see backend/README.md)
2. Open this folder in VS Code
3. Run the extension host (Run -> Start Debugging or press F5). If F5 doesn't work, ensure you opened the extension folder (not the workspace root) and that Node.js is installed.
4. Use the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and run:
   - Talk To Local AI
   - Analyze Current File
   - Apply Unified Patch
   - Run Shell Command

Tip: You can test the backend directly with curl before using the extension.
