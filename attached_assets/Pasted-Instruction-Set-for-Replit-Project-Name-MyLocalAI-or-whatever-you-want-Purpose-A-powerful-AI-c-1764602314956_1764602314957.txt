Instruction Set for Replit

Project Name: MyLocalAI (or whatever you want)

Purpose:
A powerful AI coding assistant capable of:

Analyzing code and finding errors

Debugging and applying patches automatically

Creating websites on demand

Performing research and generating code for any request

Interacting via a web API (FastAPI)

1. Import

Import the GitHub repository: https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepo.git

Language: Python

Use Python 3.11 or latest compatible version

2. Install Dependencies

Automatically install from requirements.txt:

fastapi
uvicorn
pydantic
requests
python-dotenv
gitpython


Exclude .venv/ from GitHub (already in .gitignore)

3. Setup Backend Server

The backend should be a FastAPI server listening on:

host = 0.0.0.0
port = 3000


Endpoints to create:

POST /chat – send a text prompt → AI returns code or answers

Request body:

{
  "text": "string",
  "context": "string",
  "max_tokens": 512
}


POST /analyze_file – send a file path → AI analyzes and reports issues

POST /apply_patch – send a patch string → AI applies changes to code

POST /run_command – run system commands via AI

Enable Swagger UI for testing: /docs

4. Connect AI Model

Use Ollama CLI or API to run the model qwen2.5-coder:14b

Backend function example:

import subprocess

def run_ollama(prompt: str):
    result = subprocess.run(
        ["ollama", "run", "qwen2.5-coder:14b", prompt],
        capture_output=True,
        text=True
    )
    return result.stdout


If using API, replace subprocess with API calls.

5. Allow Full AI Functionality

AI should be able to:

Generate Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or any language code

Analyze files and find issues

Suggest patches or automatically edit files

Generate fully functional websites on request

Perform research or gather information for coding tasks

6. Configure Replit Run Command

Set Replit’s run command to:

python main.py


main.py should include:

import uvicorn

if __name__ == "__main__":
    uvicorn.run("app:app", host="0.0.0.0", port=3000, reload=True)


This allows Replit to expose your API publicly.

7. Testing

Test endpoints at:

https://your-repl-name.username.repl.co/docs


Test AI functionality directly in /chat endpoint

Test code analysis and patching endpoints

✅ Result on Replit:

Fully running AI backend

Web-accessible endpoints for coding, debugging, research

Can generate websites and apply patches automatically

Ready for integration with frontend interface if desired

If you want, I can write the exact Replit-ready Python backend that implements this fully, including /chat, /analyze_file, /apply_patch, and /run_command endpoints already connected to Ollama, so you can literally just import the repo into Replit and it will work.

Do you want me to do that next?

You said:
from there how will i be using my ai inside my vscode?? or will the ai have its own frontend where i can import my github?? or can i use my ai inside my telegram bot if its possible with dashboards and everything give me a clear direction how the ai will be functioning

Perfect, now we’re talking about how your AI will actually be used. Let’s break it down clearly so you know exactly how it will function, and how you can interact with it from VSCode, web frontend, or other platforms like Telegram.

1. AI Backend (Core)

Your FastAPI backend running on Replit (or local machine) is the core engine.
It handles:

Receiving prompts via API (/chat)

Analyzing code (/analyze_file)

Applying patches (/apply_patch)

Running commands (/run_command)

Calling Ollama’s model (qwen2.5-coder:14b) to generate responses

Key idea: the AI itself doesn’t “live” in VSCode or a frontend. It’s a server that any client can talk to.

2. Using AI in VSCode

There are a few ways to integrate your AI into VSCode:

Option A: Use REST API

Your backend exposes endpoints on Replit (or localhost).

In VSCode, you can write a small Python script or VSCode extension to send requests:

import requests

url = "https://your-repl-name.username.repl.co/chat"
data = {"text": "Write a Python function to reverse a string", "context": "", "max_tokens": 512}
response = requests.post(url, json=data)
print(response.json())


You can also create a VSCode Task or Keybinding to send the current file’s code to /analyze_file and get feedback.

Option B: Dedicated VSCode Extension (optional)

You can build or customize a small VSCode extension that calls your API and shows AI responses inside VSCode panels.

This is optional but gives a native IDE feel.

3. AI Frontend

You can also build a web frontend (HTML + JS) that talks to your FastAPI backend:

Type prompts, see code generated

Upload files for analysis

Apply patches interactively

Replit already exposes /docs, which is a basic interactive frontend via Swagger.

For a nicer dashboard, you can make a custom React/Vue frontend that calls /chat and /analyze_file.

4. AI in Telegram Bot

Yes, your AI can run inside a Telegram bot:

Use Python-telegram-bot library to connect to your AI backend.

Example:

from telegram import Update
from telegram.ext import Updater, CommandHandler, MessageHandler, Filters, CallbackContext
import requests

API_URL = "https://your-repl-name.username.repl.co/chat"

def handle_message(update: Update, context: CallbackContext):
    prompt = update.message.text
    response = requests.post(API_URL, json={"text": prompt, "context": "", "max_tokens": 512})
    update.message.reply_text(response.json())

updater = Updater("YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN")
updater.dispatcher.add_handler(MessageHandler(Filters.text & ~Filters.command, handle_message))
updater.start_polling()
updater.idle()


The bot can then act as your mobile-accessible AI coding assistant.

You can even extend it to accept files, generate websites, and send patches.

5. Recommended Workflow

Backend runs on Replit or your server (FastAPI + Ollama).

VSCode usage:

Send prompts or code snippets to /chat or /analyze_file.

Receive suggestions, fixes, or generated code.

Web dashboard (optional):

Type prompts and interact visually.

Upload files for analysis.

Telegram bot (optional):

Quick access from anywhere.

Send code or prompts and get instant AI feedback.

✅ Summary

Backend: FastAPI + Ollama = core AI engine

VSCode: communicates via API → can integrate into IDE workflow

Web frontend: optional, visual dashboard for AI

Telegram bot: optional, mobile/remote access

Your AI is centralized (the backend) but fully accessible from multiple clients, giving you flexibility.
